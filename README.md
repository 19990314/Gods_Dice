# Gods_Dice
This project endeavors to simulate human society within a virtual world, serving as a reference to elucidate real-world questions. From trivial errands to philosophical theories, there are myriad complexities inherent in human existence leading to all the possibilities. Many questions are drawn without solutions such as does luck or diligence contribute more to individual success. Additionally, is there destiny giving predetermined outcomes?

"God does not play dice" Albert Einstein once said, expressing his contempt for the notion that the universe is governed by probability. For the unbalanced rules/phenomenons, he ascribed them to the hidden variable. With that said, ideally, the more comprehensive and thorough the information we incorporate, the greater the precision and accuracy the outcomes would be. Therefore, the project emphasizes the collection and integration of comprehensive information to ensure the highest possible degree of precision and accuracy for the model and its findings.
